Jukebox Starter Kit Workshop: Individual
Goal:

Demonstrate understanding of objects in JavaScript.

Assignment:

This Starter Kit workshop is designed for you to create the foundation for your next project! You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Now letâ€™s build a Jukebox!

You will build a music player that will end up playing any mp3 you can find online(Go here to legally download songs: Legal Download (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. or here on Amazon (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.).

Think about what functionality you might need for this to work. Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling jukebox.play() on your instance of Jukebox. You need an array of song objects and the ability to play, stop and pause a song.

How would you switch songs? Can you shuffle songs? Focus on getting the JavaScript to work and keep the HTML/CSS minimal, make it work before you make it look good!

Hint: The next project you will be able to continue styling this Jukebox and API integration.



Before you Begin:

Read through this tutorial describing how to use html5 audio (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. and control playback using javascript.



Your JavaScript Jukebox should:

Display at least one song on the page when the page loads

Give the user the ability to play that song, without using the "built-in" play button(i.e., don't add the controls attribute to your audio tag). This could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

Give the user the ability to stop that song without using the "built-in" stop button (i.e., don't add the controls attribute to your audio tag). Once again, this could be through a different button, through clicking or mousing over an image on the page, or any other device of your choosing.

Give the user the ability to load at least one different song into the Jukebox besides the one that is loaded when the page initially renders

The whole Jukebox should be backed by an object called Jukebox with at least the following methods: play, stop, and load songs.


Intermediate Challenge:

Add a song timer (e.g., 0:27 / 3:47) to the page
Add a pause functionality


Advanced Challenge:

Playlist of songs, shows the next song in the queue that will play next
Feature to request a random song from the playlist
Make your songs searchable by name so the user can type in a song name, if you have it, then they can select it and play it


Grading Criteria:

JS throws no errors
Pause, Play, and Stop functions work (and do not use built in functionality)
JukeBox is object-oriented
Page has at least one song on load and can play a different song based on title
Allow a user to load one of their own songs
Complete = Meets ALL grading criteria points above.

Incomplete = Does not meet all grading criteria points above. Needs improvement or missing submission.
